# ballerinaHackathonApp
This project was developed for the WSO2 Ballerina Hackathon 2017 as an Android application. The Android app demonstrates a client using the Web Socket protocol to communicate with the backend which is written using Ballerina.

In order to setup the project, first make sure to host the server application on a location accessible by the client. Afterwards, run the Android client to start communicatint with another client.
